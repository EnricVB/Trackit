## Project Overview

**Trackit** is a version control system designed to manage and track changes in your projects efficiently. It provides the same basic functionality as systems like Git, but with enhanced features and optimizations, especially for large binary files, complex merge conflicts, and fine-grained permission controls.

Trackit is implemented in Kotlin, and it leverages powerful algorithms such as BLAKE2 for data integrity and ARGON2 for password security, ensuring both performance and security are top-notch.

For more detailed information about Trackit, please refer to the README in your preferred language.
